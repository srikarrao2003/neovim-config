# neovim-config

This is my neovim config. It'll probably change a lot. It'll probably break a
lot. If you still insist on using it, here's how

- Clean out your neovim configs and plugins.
- Install vim-plug (place `plug.vim` in your `~/.config/nvim/autoload` dir)
- Place `init.vim` in `~/.config/nvim/`
- Launch `nvim` (I have it aliased to `vim`) and run `:PlugInstall`
- Wait for the plugins to install, `:q` out of the Plug installation window, and
  enjoy!
